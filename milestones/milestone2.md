## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Creating wireframes and the entity relationship diagram was easy once we had the basics from Milestone 1 complete. 

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

We faced some challenges collaborating on work, since the initial ideas came from one person mainly. 

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

As long as we keep communicating and setting goals for each other, I don't think we will need much more help.
