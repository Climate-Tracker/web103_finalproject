## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Coming up with our idea and fleshing it out went well. 

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

Some challenges we faced were communication. Since it was the first time we had to work together outside of class, we had trouble starting communication. 

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

We would like some feedback from Codepath as to whether our project idea fulfills the requirements. Furthermore, we would like any advice on our user stories and features.
