## About

### Description and Purpose

Description: This app allows users to scroll a globe, and select regions that they are interested in. When they pick a spot on the globe, they will get an option to add that city, state, or country to "Your Regions". From "Your Regions", users can select a region, at which point they will be redirected to that region's page. Here, they can see data about that region over time. They can select from the following: CO2 levels, Air Quality Index, Sea Levels, Temperature, and Deforestation. When an index is selected, a graph for that particular index over time is shown. 

Purpose: The purpose of this app is for users to become more aware of how measures of climate change have changed over time for regions that they live, have loved ones in, or are interested in. 

### Inspiration

The user can select one of the mentioned indicies at a time and see the graph associated with that index. When an index is clicked, a short paragraph explaining what that index measures, basic informaiton about it, and where this data was taken from appears.
